1) Run  " python3 /startup/startup.py"  in project.

2) enter "0"  --> 'Choose number of option: 0'
3) Fill the needed environments. That will create all env files, mqtt users and passwords,
also will create acess list

last used values (recommended for dev and tests):

    "Data base name: testdb"
    "Data base user: testadmin"
    "Data base password: testtest"
    "Data base host: localhost"
    "Broker port: 1883 (required)"
    "Global API token: a3a3d109873e7e98971639889bc0b7f2ffcd459b17397af6c73596b91b5faa89"
    "CONTROLLER MQTT USER: miagiContr"
    "PASSWORD: 1"
    "COM MQTT USER: miagiCom"
    "PASSWORD: 2"
    "EH MQTT USER: miagiEh"
    "PASSWORD: 3"
    "API MQTT USERT: miagiAPI"
    "PASSWORD: 4"


- Then continue with 'grow_automations_local_services/README.md'  but without first step ('create env: `cp env-distrib .env`')

- For mqtt client usage see in - 'grow_automations_local_services/test_scripts/README.md'
                               - 'grow_automations_local_services/test_scripts/rpi_test'

    !!! use raspberry actual IP address (may be diferent from that in Readme)
